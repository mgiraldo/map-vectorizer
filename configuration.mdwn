Here are Mauricio's requests about configuration.

If the parameters are few enough, how about using command-line flags? ::

    map-vectorize --brightness 32 --contrast -9 --threshold 94 ... mymap.tif

But you can indeed use a configuration file too. The following approaches
would probably be decent

You could import/evaluate a python file. This is convenient, but it could be
unsafe if people don't know what they're doing.

You could use ``configparser``.  Here's an example. ::

    p = configparser.ConfigParser()
    p.read_file(open('/home/tlevine/.pypirc'))
    print(p['server-login']['username'])

Or you could use any other file format you want as long as you explain to
your users how it works.
